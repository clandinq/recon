\emph{Note}: This table reports the correlation between petal width and sepal lenght and width. The unit of observation is at the plant level. The coefficients come from the regression of petal width on sepal length (column (1)), the regression of petal width on sepal length and sepal width (column (2)), and the regression of petal width on a random dummy variable, sepal length and the interaction between these two variables (column (3)). Data comes from the iris dataset. All estimations include species fixed effects, and standard errors clustered at the species level are included in parentheses. * $p < 0.1$, ** $p < 0.05$, *** $p < 0.01$.
